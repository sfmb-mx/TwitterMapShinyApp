<div class="abstract">
The purpose of this document it is to describe the use of this easy
web application.

</div>

# Main objective

The objective of this application it is build a contact (following /
followers) in the Twitter Social Network.

# About the use

The use is really straight forward. The application have only a text
box for the user that you want to track. The other is a submit button
for event handler purpose.

Debt a intense use of internet it is better to avoid the reactive
features of Shiny.

# About the constraints

For this version the exception control doesn't exist, then, if you
search for a non existing user the application will fail.

In other hand, if the user doesn't defined the location in his twitter
account the application will fail too.

I will correct this issues the next iteration of the app.

**Best!**
